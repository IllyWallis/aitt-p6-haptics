# Practical 6: Prototyping Haptics with the HTC Vive

In the lecture, we learned how haptic interfaces allow a computer to provide us with information via our sense of touch. In this practical, we are going to learn to implement some basic haptic interactions using the HTC Vive. These interactions won’t be as advanced as the examples you saw in the lecture. However, they will show you how using even the most basic vibration feedback can enhance the user experience of a VR game. You should work in groups of 2-3. When deploying your VR experiences, make sure that another team member ‘spots’ the user to make sure they don’t bump or trip into any furniture of fellow students.

To get started, make a copy of this repository (press the ```Use this template``` button) in your GitHub arccount and check it out onto your local machine. Then open up the “HapticsScene”, which contains a simple shooting gallery game.
